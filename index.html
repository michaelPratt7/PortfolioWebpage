      <h2>About Meeee</h2>
      <p>I graduated high school in 2009 as salutatorian and dropped out of college in 2012 (waste of money, waste of time).</p>
      <p>I believe in things like free healthcare/education, money is a means of control, cats are amaaaazing, and religion/politics are beyond corrupt and dysfunctional (I know, not controversial at all).</p>
      <p>I waited tables for 6 years, hating the later half after I successfully challenged myself by dragging myself out of my comfort zone and have been working security primarily ever since.</p>
      <p>What I'm hoping to achieve here with Thinkful, is to acquire marketable skills by doing something I've always been curious about but have never had the ambition (or financial desperation) to follow through. It's been said that I'm a late bloomer... so be it, let's do it.</p>
